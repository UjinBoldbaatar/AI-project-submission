# Key Findings

Neutral Tone Dominates: Most communication was professional, with positivity outweighing negativity.
Positive Employees Write More: Positive sentiment correlated with longer, more descriptive messages.
Risk Indicators: A subset of employees flagged as potential flight risks due to repeated negativity.
Predictive Insights: Sentiment trends are partially predictable with linear regression, but further modeling (e.g., ensemble methods or deep learning) may yield higher accuracy.

# Conclusion

This project successfully demonstrated how NLP and statistical analysis can provide actionable HR insights. Key outcomes include:
Automated message labeling for sentiment.
Quantifiable employee sentiment scores and rankings.
Identification of flight risks through communication patterns.
Predictive modeling showing initial potential for forecasting sentiment shifts.

# Future Work

Incorporate additional behavioral features (e.g., email response times, communication networks).

Use advanced ML models (e.g., Random Forests, Gradient Boosting, Transformers fine-tuned for enterprise data) to improve predictive power.

Build real-time monitoring dashboards for HR to track organizational sentiment continuously.
